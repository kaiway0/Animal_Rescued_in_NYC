This analysis is a part of Google data analytics certification.
I received this dataset from NYC opendata [link here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Urban-Park-Ranger-Animal-Condition-Response/fuhs-xmg2/data_preview)

This data is made available by NYC department of parks and recreation about different animals rescued from the years 2018 to 2023.
In this analysis, I will use this dataset to see the different distribution rescue and relocation of different types of animal species in NYC.
